The solution involves careful debugging and testing to identify the specific configuration causing the issue.  There's no single fix, as the problem depends on the custom settings used. Below are strategies:

1. **Simplify Configuration:** Start by removing custom parameters from the Camera component. Gradually reintroduce settings to pinpoint the problematic one.
2. **Check Device Compatibility:**  Ensure all used features and parameters are supported by the target devices. Expo's documentation provides details on supported features.
3. **Error Handling:** Add more comprehensive error handling to capture and log any exceptions during camera initialization or image capture.  This helps identify the root cause even if the preview doesn't show the problem immediately.
4. **Fallback Mechanism:** Provide a fallback mechanism to display an informative message or use a different camera mode if the custom configuration is problematic on a particular device.
5. **Update Expo SDK:** Ensure you're using the latest version of the Expo SDK, as newer versions often contain bug fixes and performance improvements.

```javascript
// bugSolution.js
export default function CameraScreen() {
  // ... (rest of the code remains similar)

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Camera style={styles.camera} type={type} onMountError={(error) => {
          console.error('Camera mount error:', error);
          //Display an alternative message or view
        }}>
        {/*Camera Controls*/}
      </Camera>
    </View>
  );
}
```
